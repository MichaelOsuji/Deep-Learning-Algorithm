# Deep Learning Models
In this folder I developed and fine-tuned the deep learning models to detect pneumonia from chest radiograph scans (X-rays). This will be an ongoing project and will cover the following algorithms:

- ResNet50 :heavy_check_mark:
- VGG19
- InceptionV3 :heavy_check_mark:
- Basic CNN :heavy_check_mark:
- EfficientNet
